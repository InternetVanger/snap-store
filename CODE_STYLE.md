- Golden rule - match existing code for style.
- Indentation is 4 spaces.
- No tab characters.
- No line limit for characters, but use multiple lines to aid readibility.
- Braces start on the ends of lines.
- Use GTK widget types, not treat everything as GtkWidget (i.e. GtkLabel instead of GtkWidget).
- All UI in GtkTemplates.
- Only worker threads allowed.
- Use g_auto for memory management - no explicit unrefs / frees.
- No compile warnings.
- Fields, functions in alphabetical order.
- Files laid out in order of:
  - Private functions.
  - Class functions.
  - Public functions.
